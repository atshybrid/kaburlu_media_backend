```

### 3. Reporter

**Who can access:** Reporter only (only their own articles)

**Filters:**
- `priority` - Filter by priority (1, 2, or 3)

- `minChars` - Minimum character count

curl 'https://api.kaburlumedia.com/api/v1/articles/list/reporter?priority=1&date=2026-02-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'

# Get my articles with more than 1000 characters
curl 'https://api.kaburlumedia.com/api/v1/articles/list/reporter?minChars=1000' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

**Response:** Same structure but without reporter details (since it's the user's own articles)

---

## Priority Levels

- **1** = High priority (breaking news, important stories)
- **2** = Medium priority (regular news)
- **3** = Low priority (fillers, less urgent content) - **default**

---

## Location Hierarchy Behavior

### State Filter
When you filter by `stateId`, you get articles from:
- Reporters assigned to that state directly
- Reporters assigned to any district in that state
- Reporters assigned to any mandal in any district in that state

### District Filter
When you filter by `districtId`, you get articles from:
- Reporters assigned to that district directly
- Reporters assigned to any mandal in that district

### Mandal Filter
When you filter by `mandalId`, you get articles from:
- Only reporters assigned to that specific mandal

---

## Database Migration Required

Before using these APIs, run the migration to add the `priority` field:

```bash
cd ~/kaburlu_media_backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
pm2 restart kaburlu-api
```

This adds:
- `priority Int @default(3)` to Article model
- Index on priority field for fast queries

---

## Use Cases

### Super Admin Dashboard
```javascript
// Get all breaking news from all tenants today
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/superadmin?priority=1&page=1&limit=100')

// Monitor specific tenant's activity
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/superadmin?tenantId=XXX&date=2026-02-05')

// Find long-form articles (investigative journalism)
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/superadmin?minChars=2000')
```

### Tenant Admin Dashboard
```javascript
// Get today's articles by priority
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/tenant?priority=1')
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/tenant?priority=2')

// Monitor specific district coverage
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/tenant?districtId=XXX')

// Get reporter's daily output
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/tenant?reporterId=YYY&date=2026-02-05')
```

### Reporter Dashboard
```javascript
// My today's work
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/reporter')

// Check quota compliance (with quota API)
const quota = await fetch('/api/v1/reporter/article-quota')
const articles = await fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/reporter?priority=1')
// Show: "You've posted 3/5 high-priority articles today"

// Review past work
fetch('/api/v1/articles/list/reporter?date=2026-02-01')
```

## Notes

- Date filter defaults to **today** (current UTC date) if not specified
- Character count is calculated from the `content` field length
- Results are ordered by `createdAt DESC` (newest first)
- Maximum 200 items per page for performance
- Location filters only work if reporter has location assignment in their profile
- Response always includes `characterCount` for each article
